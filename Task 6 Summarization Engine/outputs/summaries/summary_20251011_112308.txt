This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) governs electrolytic plating and oxidation, mandating efficient exhaust ventilation for all vessels. It prohibits women, adolescents, and children from working at baths, and requires waterproof, level, daily-washed floors. The occupier must provide, maintain, and ensure the use of specific protective devices (waterproof aprons/bibs, rubber gloves, boots, and chemical goggles) for bath workers.

Suitable washing facilities (including 1 basin per 5 persons, constant water, daily clean towels, and soap) and an emergency shower with an eye fountain and 1500-litre water tank are also required. A prominent, translated cautionary placard must warn of corrosive/poisonous chemicals, prohibit eating/drinking, advise on skin absorption, and mandate washing, PPE use, immediate spill cleaning, and regular medical tests. Factories must provide an accessible first aid box containing barrier cream, ointment, and waterproof plaster, plus an emergency cyanide kit if cyanides are used.
